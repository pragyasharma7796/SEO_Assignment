 Benefits of using meta tags

improve a webpage’s visibility on search engine result pages (SERPs). A well-crafted meto description can
attract users to click on the link, while the keywords tag, although less impactful than in the past, can still
provide search engines with relevant information about the pages content.

• Social Media Sharing: Meta tags like the Open Graph Protocol tags allow developers to control how web
pages are displayed when shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedln. They define
the title, description, and image that appear in social media posts, making shared links more attractive and
informative.

• Character Encoding and Language: The meta tag specifying the character encoding (e.g., UTF-8) ensures
that the browser interprets the text correctly, especially when dealing with special characters or multilingual
content.

• Viewport Control: The viewport meto tag is crucial for responsive web design. It allows developers to set the
initial scale and width of the viewport, making sure the webpage adapts well to different screen sizes and
resolutions,

• HTTP-Equiv Tags: Meto tags with http-equiv attribute (e.g <meto http-equiv=refresh”>) enable specific HTTP
header functionalities, like refreshing or redirecting the page after a certain time. While overusing them can
be detrimental, there ore valid use cases for handling page behavior.

• Web Accessibility: Certain meta tags can improve web accessibility by providing additional information to
assistive technologies, making It easier for users with disabilities to navigate and understand the content.
