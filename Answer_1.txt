What is SEO:-
SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It helps you optimize your websites so that they have better
rankings on Search Engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo.

The ultimate goal of SEO is to rank higher in search engine results pages for relevant keywords and phrases,
which can increase visibility, traffic, and ultimately revenue for the website.

It is essential for businesses that want to succeed in the digital age. In HTML, a common way to help search
engines is to include document titles and some important meta tags.

Meta tags are important for SEO because they provide information to search engines about the content on your
site and can help improve your websites visibility and ranking in search engine results pages

The <head> tag in HTML:- It is indeed an element that contains important information and metadata about the
document. It is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag. The <head> tag typically includes various
elements that provide additional Information and instructions to the web browser and search engines.
The head tag in HTML can consist of a Meta tag, tile tag, script tag, and so on.

The title, link, style, and meta are some of the tags that are commonly used inside the head tag.
Let’s understand them (title, link, style, and meto) in detail.

The title tag <title>: The ‘title’ tag specifies the title of the document, which is displayed as the page title in
the browser’s title bar or tab. It helps users identify the webpage and search engines understand the page’s
content.

 The link tag <link>: The <link> tag is used to reference external resources such as CSS stylesheets, icon files
(favicon), or alternate versions of the page for different devices or languages.

The style tag <styte>: The <style> tag is used to define internal CSS styles that are applied to the
document. It allows you to specify custom styling rules for elements on the page.

The meta tag <meta>: The <meta> tag provides metadata about the document, including character
encoding, viewport settings for responsive design, author information, keywords, and descriptions for search
engines.

These elements within the <head> tag are essential for providing relevant Information, optimizing the
document for search engines, and controlling various aspects of the web pages presentation and
behaviour.

Its important to note that the <head> tag does not directly affect the visible content of the webpage but
plays a crucial role in enhancing the user experience, improving search engine visibility, and controlling the
presentation and functionality of the document.
The head tag in HTML is a crucial element for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) as it provides important
information and signals to search engines about the web pages content
